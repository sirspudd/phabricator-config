https://secure.phabricator.com/book/phabricator/article/installation_guide/

checked in the install_ubuntu.sh used to create our first instance.
checked in a mirror of the guide above, just in case

To formalize what was required of me:

Create AWS instance
Choose Ubuntu as baseline
Log in using pem file
Run above script (install_ubuntu.sh)
Follow installation guide given above (checked in for completeness)
unblock inbound http traffic
create mysql password for root user: dpkg-reconfigure mysql-server-5.5
configure mysql username/password in phabricator
adjust apache configuration as indicated in the guide (path change, and php related permissions)

This suffices to get the phabricator app running and accessible at your public ip addr.
At outset, I had 17 outstanding issues which it steps you through correcting.
